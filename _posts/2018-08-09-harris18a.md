title: An Architecture and Domain Specific Language Framework for Repeated Domain-Specific
  Predictive Modeling
abstract: When repeatedly fitting related predictive models within the same domain,
  for similar problems, itâ€™s helpful to have tools to support an efficient, high-quality
  workflow. This paper describes a theory of the architecture for such tools and for
  the interfaces among predictive models and other aspects of a software system. Additionally,
  it describes an open-source reference implementation of this design, written in
  R, focusing on a Domain Specific Language for one specific repeated predictive modeling
  task.
