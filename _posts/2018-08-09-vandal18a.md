title: Prediction and Uncertainty Quantification of Daily Airport Flight Delays
abstract: One in four commercial airline flights is delayed, inconveniencing travelers
  and causing large financial losses for carriers. The ability to accurately predict
  delays would make travelersâ€™ lives easier and save airlines money. In this work,
  we approach the problem of predicting flight delays using a Variational Long Short-Term
  Memory (LSTM) model. The model is trained to predict aggregate daily delays for
  U.S. airports using a combination of continuous and discrete variables, including
  weather, airport characteristics, and congestion. Monte Carlo Dropout, a Bayesian
  Deep Learning technique based on variational inference, is incorporated to provide
  planners with a well-calibrated prediction interval. We show that our Variational
  LSTM results in an average median absolute error of 5.8 minutes per day across 123
  airports in the United States. Moreover, results show that predictive uncertainty
  is well explained through a calibration analysis.
