title: Flexible and Scalable Deep Learning with MMLSpark
abstract: In this work we detail a novel open source library, called MMLSpark, that
  combines the flexible deep learning library Cognitive Toolkit, with the distributed
  computing framework Apache Spark. To achieve this, we have contributed Java Language
  bindings to the Cognitive Toolkit, and added several new components to the Spark
  ecosystem. In addition, we also integrate the popular image processing library OpenCV
  with Spark, and present a tool for the automated generation of PySpark wrappers
  from any SparkML estimator and use this tool to expose all work to the PySpark ecosystem.
  Finally, we provide a large library of tools for working and developing within the
  Spark ecosystem. We apply this work to the automated classification of Snow Leopards
  from camera trap images, and provide an end to end solution for the non-profit conservation
  organization, the Snow Leopard Trust.
