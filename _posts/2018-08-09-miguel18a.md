title: Marvin - Open source artificial intelligence platform
abstract: Marvin is an open source project that focuses on empowering data science
  teams to deliver industrial-grade applications supported by a high-scale, low-latency,
  language agnostic and standardized architecture platform, while simplifying the
  process of exploration and modeling. Building model-dependent applications in a
  robust way is not trivial, one is required to have knowledge in advanced areas of
  sciences like computing, statistics and math. Marvin aims at abstracting the complexities
  in the creation process of scalable, highly available, interoperable and maintainable
  predictive software.
