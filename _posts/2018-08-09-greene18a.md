title: 'DragonPaint: Rule Based Bootstrapping for Small Data with an Application to
  Cartoon Coloring'
abstract: In this paper, we confront the problem of deep learningâ€™s big labeled data
  requirements, offer a rule based strategy for extreme augmentation of small data
  sets and apply that strategy with the image to image translation model by \citetpix2pix:16
  to automate cel style cartoon coloring with very limited training data.  While our
  experimental results using geometric rules and transformations demonstrate the performance
  of our methods on an image translation task with industry applications in art, design
  and animation, we also propose the use of rules on partial data sets as a generalizable
  small data strategy, potentially applicable across data types and domains.
